            Hello, welcome to my about my web page. Here on this main page,
            I have links that direct you to other pages relating to some of
            my favorite things in the world. Before you wander around the other
            pages, I'll tell you a little bit about me. My name is Isaiah Rodriguez, and I am currently
            a senior student at <span style="color:rgb(124, 124, 255)">Chiawana High School</span>. And I live in Pasco, a place of 
            good weather. Now you can go ahead and click some of the web page links to 
            discover what I enjoy and like.  
    
    
        </p>
